# Sample for create molecule test instance on VMware

This is a sample to create a test instance of [molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on VMware environment.  
Samples for Linux and Windows are prepared.

## How to create molecule test instance on VMware environment

### Requirements

To create a test instance required following.

* vCenter Server
* template vm
* template vm snapshot

The reason required a snapshot is because test instances are created with a linked clone.

### Run the sample

The sample this repository provides Linux (linux_ping) and Windows (win_ping) roles.  
To run the sample, change the variable in the molecule.yml file.

|    os   |               molecule.yml path                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| linux   | roles/linux_ping/molecule/default/molecule.yml |
| windows | roles/win_ping/molecule/default/molecule.yml   |

#### When creating multiple test instances

Define multiple platforms as in the following example.

```yaml
(snip)
platforms:
  - name: instance1
    template: template name
    snapshot_src: snapshot for template
    memory_mb: 2048
    cpus: 2
    network: VM Network
    datastore: datastore name
  - name: instance2
    template: template name
    snapshot_src: snapshot for template
    memory_mb: 2048
    cpus: 2
    network: VM Network
    datastore: datastore name
(snip)
```

#### Demo

The following is demos when the sample is run.

**Linux**

**Windows**

### How to use it for testing other roles

Test with other roles is easy.
Copy each molecule directory to the role to be test.  
It is `roles/linux_ping/molecule/` for Linux and `roles/win_ping/molecule` for Windows.  
After copying the directory, change the variable file and run the `molecule test` command.
